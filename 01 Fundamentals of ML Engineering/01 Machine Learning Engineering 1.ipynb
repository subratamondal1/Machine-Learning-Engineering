    "**Redirection** in UNIX is a way of changing the source or destination of input and output data for a command. It allows you to use files or other commands as input or output instead of the keyboard or the screen. For example, you can save the output of a command to a file, or use the content of a file as input for a command.\n",

    "- **Standard input (stdin):** The source of input data for a command. By default, it is the keyboard. Its stream ID is 0.\n",
    "- **Standard output (stdout):** The output of a command. By default, it is the screen. Its stream ID is 1.\n",
    "- **Standard error (stderr):** The error message (if any) produced by a command. By default, it is also the screen. Its stream ID is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modes of redirection are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overwrite redirection:** This mode replaces the existing content of a file with the output of a command. It uses the symbol `>` for stdout and `<` for stdin. For example, `ls > output.txt` will save the output of the `ls` command to a file named output.txt, and erase any previous content of that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Append redirection:** This mode adds the output of a command to the end of a file, without erasing the existing content. It uses the symbol `>>` for stdout and `<<` for stdin. For example, `date >> output.txt` will append the output of the `date` command to the file output.txt, and preserve the previous content of that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pipe redirection:** This mode redirects the output of one command to the input of another command. It uses the symbol `|` to connect two commands. For example, `ls | wc -l` will count the number of lines in the output of the `ls` command."
